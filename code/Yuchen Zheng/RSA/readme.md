I.File functions:

RSA_Generates_Public_And_Private_Keys.py:

Function: Generate the public and private keys required for RSA encryption.
Role interaction: the private key is kept secret by its holder (Bob), while the public key is made public and may be used by other roles (such as Alice and Eve).

RSA_Generates_Encrypted_Information.py:

Function: Use the public key to encrypt information.
Role interaction: Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message, and the resulting encrypted message can be received by Bob (and potentially Eve).

RSA_Generates_Decryption_Information.py:

Function: Use the private key to decrypt information.
Role interaction: Bob uses his private key to decrypt the encrypted message sent by Alice. If Eve tries to decrypt the message, she cannot succeed unless she can find Bob's private key.

RSA_Generate_Hacker.py:

Function: Try to crack the encrypted information.
Role interaction: Eve uses this script to try to decrypt Alice's message by prime factorizing the modulus n in Bob's public key.

RSA_public_and_private_keys.txt:

Function: Contains public and private key information.
Role interaction: The public key is public and can be used by all participants, while the private key must be kept secret and known only to its owner.

RSA_Encrypted_Information.txt and RSA_Decryption_Information.txt:

Function: Contains encrypted and decrypted information respectively.
Role interaction: The encrypted information (RSA_Encrypted_Information.txt) is generated by Alice and sent to Bob (Eve may also intercept it), while the decrypted information (RSA_Decryption_Information.txt) is obtained by Bob using his own private key and should not be known to Eve in theory. .

RSA_Unit_Test.py:

Function: Used to test the correctness of RSA encryption and decryption functions.

II.Usage process:

1. RSA_Generates_Public_And_Private_Keys.py:

First run this script to generate the public and private keys. This is the basis for establishing RSA encrypted communication.
The generated public key and private key information will be saved in "RSA_public_and_private_keys.txt", which contains a total of modulus n, public key e and private key d. e and d need to be used in conjunction with n.

2. RSA_Generates_Encrypted_Information.py:

Alice (or any sender) uses Bob's public key (obtained from "RSA_public_and_private_keys.txt", containing modulus n and public key e) to encrypt her message.
The encrypted message will be saved in "RSA_Encrypted_Information.txt".

3. RSA_Generates_Decryption_Information.py:

Bob (or any recipient) uses his private key (obtained from "RSA_public_and_private_keys.txt", containing modulus n and private key d) to decrypt the encrypted message sent by Alice.
The decrypted message will be saved in "RSA_Decryption_Information.txt".

4. RSA_Generate_Hacker.py:

This script simulates a hacker (Eve) trying to crack an RSA encrypted message.
It attempts to decrypt the encrypted message by obtaining the private key by prime factorizing the modulus n in the public key.

5. RSA_Unit_Test.py:

This script can be used to test the correctness of the encryption and decryption process, ensuring that everything is working as expected.

III.Test method

Run RSA_Unit_Test.py to perform unit testing.
