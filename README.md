[[[Tasks]]]:
1. Use of ElGamal encryption to
    a. Encrypt and send a message (Alice)
    b. Receive and decrypt a message (Bob)
    c. Eavesdrop and decrypt the message (Eve)
2. Use of RSA encryption to
    a. Encrypt and send a message (Alice)
    b. Receive and decrypt a message (Bob)
    c. Eavesdrop and decrypt the message (Eve)
- Every person must perform all the roles for both types of encryption and should participate in all exchanges. 

[[[Deliverables]]]:
1. The full source code of the algorithms used, written in any language.
2. Any unit tests youâ€™ve used to test your algorithms.
3. A manual or directions on how to use the algorithms, in practice, and exercise the unit tests. Unit tests should be comprehensive and test ALL your algorithms in multiple ways, considering edge cases and with close to 100% test coverate.
4. Documentation of each of the exchanges listed above in the roles of Alice, Bob, and Eve, showing how keys were generated, how encryption was performed, any encrypted messages received or eavesdropped, and the output. That is, each exchange must identify all the parameters used to complete the role (e.g., modulus of the group, prime numbers, messages, encrypted messages, etc.) Email might be useful to document the actual exchanges between parties.
5. All of the above should be provided in the form of a zip file, git repository, or GitHub repository.
